The sound effects for the buttons were grabbed from FreeSound, they are mechanical and the stop sound has an added reverberation from the tape deck.
The song I decided to use is Giant Steps by John Coltrane, the design was simple however the song is quite long so in order to test if the functionality worked properly I had to wait for a good minute or so to reach the end.
All of the buttons work as intended and the app functions as a digital cassette deck.
