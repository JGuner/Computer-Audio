My ducking technique utilizes a filter in which filters out the higher frequencies within the background loop and also lowers the loop's gain to 75% of the original value. 
Then, an end listener is used to tell when the GPS clip is finished to reset the filter so nothing is filtered and reset the gain to the original value.
The only issue I ran into is when overriding the messageReceived method I misspelled the method and the background loop would never recover from the ducking of the audio.
The ducking works better than I expected.
